- SQL Queries are of four types:

    - DDL – Data Definition Language
    - DQl – Data Query Language
    - DML – Data Manipulation Language
    - DCL – Data Control Language

- SQL vs NoSQL
    - SQL databases can be scaled horizontally as well, though sharding or partitioning logic is often the user’s onus and not well supported.
    - NoSQL technologies are diverse and while many rely on the master-slave architecture, options for scaling vertically also exist.
 
- SQL vs PL/SQL
    - SQL is data oriented language. SQL is used to write queries, create and execute DDL and DML statments. 
    - PL/SQL is application oriented language. PL/SQL is used to write program blocks, functions, procedures, triggers and packages. 

- DBMS supports ACID property- Atomicity, Consistent, Isolated & Durability. 
    - Atomicity: All changes to the data will be made completely or not at all.
    - Consistent: Data must be consistent before and after transaction.
    - Isolated: No other process can effect the ongoing transactions
    - Durable: The changes must persist once made.

- Data warehousing is a centralised data management process where data from all resources comes to one place and all this data is used in decision- making in an organisation.

- An E-R model referes to a diagrammatic approach to db design by taking account of a real- life entities and establishing relationship between them.

- TRUNCATE is like DELETE, only it removes all the data.

- In a **shared lock**, for reading and multiple transactions can access the resource while in **exclusive lock** is about performing a write operation.

- Normalisation is by dividing data in different tables, while denormalisation using for example, JOIN IN, does the opposite.
