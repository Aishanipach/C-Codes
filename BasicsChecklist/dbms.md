- SQL Queries are of four types:

    - DDL – Data Definition Language
    - DQl – Data Query Language
    - DML – Data Manipulation Language
    - DCL – Data Control Language

- SQL vs NoSQL
    - SQL databases can be scaled horizontally as well, though sharding or partitioning logic is often the user’s onus and not well supported.
    - NoSQL technologies are diverse and while many rely on the master-slave architecture, options for scaling vertically also exist.
 
- SQL vs PL/SQL
    - SQL is data oriented language. SQL is used to write queries, create and execute DDL and DML statments. 
    - PL/SQL is application oriented language. PL/SQL is used to write program blocks, functions, procedures, triggers and packages.
