- SQL Queries are of four types:

    - DDL – Data Definition Language
    - DQl – Data Query Language
    - DML – Data Manipulation Language
    - DCL – Data Control Language

- SQL vs NoSQL
    - SQL databases can be scaled horizontally as well, though sharding or partitioning logic is often the user’s onus and not well supported.
    - NoSQL technologies are diverse and while many rely on the master-slave architecture, options for scaling vertically also exist.
